# BioSIM - Bioaerosol Simulation Chamber
Deciphering the Role of Atmospheric Microbial Aerosols (DRAMA)

DRAMA will determine the mechanism of bioaerosol induced ice formation through a series of interlinked cross-disciplinary mechanistic studies bridging from molecules to cells

Interdisciplinary project between:

- Department of Microbiology, Molecular Biology, Chemistry and Engineering at AU and collaborators at University of Vienna, Gothenburg and Stockholm.


Study bioaerosols under realistic atmospheric conditions while airborne

- Use an electrodynamic field to levitate particles
- Expose them to different relative humidities and temperatures
- Monitor changes in their physical and biological properties 
- Deposition of water and ice on cell surfaces
- Change in size/mass due to water uptake 
- Hygroscopicity as a response to stress that cells encounter in the atmosphere, including high salinity, UV radiation and low pH
- Emission of fluorescent light after exposure to specific conditions
- Change in phase state (liquid/solid)
